# Blue Bird
A marker based Augmented Reality experiment developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/).

To try it out on your phone, [downlaod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Kolapo.HappyHour) the android apk and install. Run the app and point your phone camera towards a US one-dollar bill or a hundred naira note, then watch the cute bird pop the balloons.

## Development
Download the project and open with Unity. The markers used in the project are a hundred naira note and a US one-dollar bill but you can always replace that by generating your own AR marker through the Vuforia developer portal. To run on your mobile phone, build the project to an iOS or Android device.

# Happy Hour
A marker based Augmented Reality experiment I developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/).

To try it out, downlaod the android apk and install. The marker used in the project is a one dollare note so after installing and runnign, point your phone to a one dollar note and watch the cute bird pop the balloons.

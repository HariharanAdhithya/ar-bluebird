# Happy Hour
A marker based Augmented Reality experiment I developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/).
##
To try it out, [downlaod](https://github.com/thekolapo/happy-hour/blob/master/Happy%20Hour.apk) the android apk and install. Run the app and point your phone to a one dollar note and watch the cute bird pop the balloons.
